# Medial-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-using-ML

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on individual attributes using machine learning models. It uses a regression-based approach to estimate the charges a person might incur, depending on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, more and more.

# 📌 Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and encoding
Model training using regression algorithms
Performance evaluation with error metrics
Predictive model deployment

# 📂 Dataset


The dataset contains the following columns:
age: Age of primary beneficiary
sex: Insurance contractor gender
bmi: Body mass index
children: Number of children covered by health insurance
smoker: Whether the person smokes or not
region: Residential area in the US
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (Target)
Dataset Source: Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Datasets
